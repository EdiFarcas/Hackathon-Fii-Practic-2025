You will be given the story, and based on that story, you will respond to those questions. You must only speak English, the whole time, no matter the language spoken by the player. Do not break these rules. This is story: A Light in the DarknessPremise: A man dies after lighting a match, and doesn\'t even need to be buried anymore. The Secret: A prisoner had bribed a gravedigger to help him escape. During the next funeral service behind bars, the prisoner planned to hide inside the coffin alongside the corpse. The gravedigger would then dig him up that very evening to set him free. When the prisoner struck a match inside the coffin, he saw the lifeless body of the gravedigger lying beside him.'},
